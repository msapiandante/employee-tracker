# employee-tracker
## Description

I was tasked with creating a command-line application that would allow an employer to view and edit a database that displayed various data about a company, such as departments, managers and salaries- just to name a few. I learned how to use mysql. I also further developed my knoweldge of working node.js. I enjoyed this project, I am still in the process of debugging the "add a role", "add an employee", "update employee role" functions. I look forward to continue learning and building my skill set. Mysql syntax has been my favorite so far!
